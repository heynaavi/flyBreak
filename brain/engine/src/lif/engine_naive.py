"""Phase 1: the deliberately slow lane.

One mx.eval() per tick. This is the shape of implementation that flyBrain
reports having abandoned, and it is the baseline every phase-2 claim is measured
against -- on this machine, not against someone else's M3 Max.

The tick body follows the Brian2 ordering exactly:
  1. refractory refresh, then the exact linear update of v and g (non-refractory only)
  2. strict threshold, v > V_TH, gated by not-refractory
  3. delayed spikes read out of the ring (emitted DELAY_TICKS ago)
  4. signed contact counts scattered onto destinations, then external drive on v
  5. reset, refractory reload, ring store
