"""Phase 5: sparse CSR propagation via mx.fast.metal_kernel.

Phases 1-4 established that the cost is not host synchronisation but the dense
sweep: every tick touches all 14,687,178 edges regardless of how few neurons
fired. Pure MLX cannot avoid that, because compacting the spike list has a
data-dependent output size and MLX has no way to express one in a lazy graph.

A hand-written Metal kernel can. One thread per neuron, each thread returning
immediately unless its neuron fired. Only the edges of neurons that actually
spiked are ever loaded. The dispatch stays dense (127,400 threads, statically
sized, no host readback), while the memory traffic becomes sparse.

Accumulation is int32 atomic_fetch_add. Integer addition is associative and
commutative and cannot overflow in this range, so the result is independent of
thread completion order -- deterministic, unlike float atomics.

# EDGE_SPLIT threads cooperate on each source neuron's edge list, striding

# precisely the biggest hubs, so a single thread would serialise ~9600 atomics

# the sparse lane 2.06x as slow as it needs to be. And on the sugar drive the
# fused lane at the sparse lane's K=2 takes 1.16x its time at K=1, while the
# sparse lane at K=1 is within 0.1 % of K=2, so a benchmark that forces 2 on both
# misreports the fused lane.
#
# There is still no runtime-choosable value: picking K from the live spike count
# needs a host readback, which is exactly the synchronisation the chunked design
# exists to avoid. So it stays a parameter, now with measured defaults.

# Silencing empties a source's edge range. The kernel reads where each range ends
# from a per-run array: row_ptr[i + 1], except for a silenced source, whose range
# ends where it starts, so its loop never runs. Whether a source spikes is decided
# elsewhere, so a silenced neuron still fires and still counts (see
# core.silenced_mask). engine_naive and engine_chunked zero the same edges'
# counts instead. Without a mask the array is a view of row_ptr.
#
# Not in the early exit, where the first version tested it
# (`if (!spike[i] || silenced[i]) return;`): all N * K threads run that line, and
# the cost of the extra read grew with K. Measured 2026-09-14, fused lane,
